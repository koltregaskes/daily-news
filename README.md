# Daily News

This repository hosts a static website that aggregates daily AI news articles.  
News stories are stored in markdown files named `YYYY_MM_DD.md` and the site automatically reads these files to build a searchable archive.

The website provides:

- Highlighted stories for the current day
- Search and filter by date and source
- Dynamic tags extracted from article titles
- A sidebar with quick filters and an archive picker

To view the site locally simply open `index.html` in a browser.
